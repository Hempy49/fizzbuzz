# Fizzbuzz

This project was created to help me build up my experience in RSpec.

## What's in this project
- The [fizzBuzz_spec.rb](https://github.com/Hempy49/fizzbuzz/blob/master/spec/fizzbuzz_spec.rb) file. Lists all tests and their expectations.
- The [fizzbuzz.rb](https://github.com/Hempy49/fizzbuzz/blob/master/lib/fizzbuzz.rb) file. This contains the relevant Fizzbuzz method.

## How to run
On your machine, RSpec must first be installed. To do this, simply enter the following:

```shell
gem install rspec
```

Once RSpec is installed, and you are in the FizzBuzz directory, simply run:

```shell
rspec
```

This will list out which tests have passed, and which ones have failed.
